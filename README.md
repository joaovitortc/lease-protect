# LeaseProtec

LeaseProtec is a groundbreaking solution developed during the Seneca Hackathon, aimed at revolutionizing the rental industry by addressing the urgent need for transparency, security, and efficiency in lease agreements.

## Overview

Traditional lease contracts often lack transparency and require manual preservation, leading to inefficiencies and potential disputes. LeaseProtec leverages Ethereum blockchain technology to provide an inherently secure environment for managing lease agreements.

## Features

- **Transparency**: LeaseProtec ensures maximum transparency by utilizing Ethereum blockchain technology.
  
- **Security**: Personal details are kept confidential through selective display of attributes via hashes.
  
- **Efficiency**: The web platform digitizes and automates the leasing process, minimizing delays and providing easy access for both landlords and tenants.

## Tech Stack

LeaseProtec's tech stack includes:

- **Blockchain Tools**: Ethereum blockchain tools such as MetaMask for wallet interaction, Truffle Suite for smart contract development, and Ganache for local blockchain testing.
  
- **Smart Contract Development**: Solidity is used for coding smart contracts.
  
- **Web Development**: Next.js and React are utilized for web development.
  
- **Database**: MongoDB serves as the database solution.
  
- **Document Storage**: Cloudinary is used for handling document storage.
  
- **Authentication**: Auth0 by Okta ensures secure user authentication.
