            <p><strong>üöÄ Seneca Hackathon üöÄ</strong></p>
            <p>I'm absolutely grateful to have been a part of this incredible event! First and foremost, I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to my amazing teammates: Shrey Bhatt, Mabel Zhou and Emily Fagin. Working alongside each of you was an absolute privilege.</p>
            <p>üí° Together, we brought our vision to life with LeaseProtec, our groundbreaking solution revolutionizing the rental industry! We recognized the urgent need for transparency, security, and efficiency when talking about lease agreements. Traditional contracts often lack transparency and require manual preservation, but not ours. Our system provides an inherently secure environment using Ethereum blockchain technology. We ensure maximum transparency while safeguarding privacy through selective display of attributes via hashes, keeping personal details confidential. Our web platform digitizes and automates the process, minimizing delays, and allowing easy access for landlords and tenants. üåêüîê</p>
            <p>Our tech stack comprises Ethereum blockchain tools like MetaMask for wallet interaction, Truffle Suite for smart contract development, and Ganache for local blockchain testing. Solidity is used for smart contract coding. For the web development, we utilized Next.js and React. MongoDB serves as our database solution, while Cloudinary handles documents storage and Auth0 by Okta ensures secure user authentication.</p>
            <p>It was amazing to learn new technologies and methodologies throughout this project, but perhaps the most valuable aspect of this event was the insights and guidance we received from our mentors and judges. Special thanks to Jeff Pledger, Suzanne M. Pledger, Colin Rees, Daniel Rizzi ü¶â, Mark Buchner and Manish Dixit. Your wisdom and support were invaluable, and we are incredibly grateful for the opportunity to learn from you.</p>
            <p>And finally, a massive thank you to the Seneca Hackathon organizing team for putting together such an incredible event! Your hard work and dedication made this experience truly unforgettable.</p>
